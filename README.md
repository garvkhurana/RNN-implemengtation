# Text Classification with RNN and NLP

This repository contains a project for text classification using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and various NLP preprocessing techniques. The model achieves an accuracy of 72% on the dataset. The project involves text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and fitting an RNN model. The implementation of transformers is planned for future improvements.


## Introduction

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for text classification using NLP preprocessing techniques and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The preprocessing includes cleaning the text, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. The RNN model is trained on the preprocessed data and achieves an accuracy of 72%.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NLTK
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (for Keras)

### Installing Dependencies

Use the following commands to install the required packages:

bash
pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
NLTK Data
Ensure you have the necessary NLTK data packages. You can download them using the following Python code:

python
Copy code
import nltk

nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('punkt')
If you encounter issues downloading the punkt package, you can manually download it from NLTK Data and place it in the nltk_data/tokenizers/ directory.

Usage
Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing steps involve:

Removing non-alphabetic characters.
Converting text to lowercase.
Tokenizing the text.
Removing stopwords.
Lemmatizing the words.
Joining the words back into a single string for each review.
RNN Model
The RNN model is constructed using Keras and includes:

An Embedding layer.
A SimpleRNN layer.
A Dense output layer.
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function. It is trained on the preprocessed data.

Results
The RNN model achieves an accuracy of 72% on the provided dataset.

Future Work
Implement Transformers: Future improvements will include implementing transformer-based models such as BERT for better performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model.
Larger Dataset: Use a larger and more diverse dataset for training
